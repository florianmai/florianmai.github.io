Florian is a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the [Language Intelligence & Information Retrieval lab at KU Leuven](https://liir.cs.kuleuven.be/people.php), led by Marie-Francine Moens, where he works on learning planning components for [language modeling from unlabeled data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00614). Before that he received his PhD from EPFL and worked in the Natural Language Understanding group at Idiap Research Institute led by James Henderson. [His PhD thesis](https://infoscience.epfl.ch/entities/publication/da7832d4-78b9-43db-b2fa-098893e27677) aims to decrease the costs of natural language understanding in terms of processing time ([CMOW sentence embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06423) and [HyperMixer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03691)), required [labeled data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02983), and [hyperparameter tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11758).

During his master's studies, he worked as a student research assistant with Ansgar Scherp at Leibniz Information Centre for Economics - ZBW. He studied several NLP-related topics like [topical document classification in digital libraries](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06717) and [citation recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.12366).
