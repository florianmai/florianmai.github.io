I am PhD candidate in the Natural Language Understanding group at Idiap Research Institute and EPFL, under the supervision of James Henderson. My main research interest is text representation learning: How do we [encode text efficiently](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06423)? Can we [learn conditional text generation tasks in the embedding space of a text autoencoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02983)? In this context, how do we [account for variable length text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07002)?

During my master's studies, I worked as a student research assistant with Ansgar Scherp at Leibniz Information Centre for Economics - ZBW. I studied several NLP-related topics like [topical document classification in digital libraries](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06717) and [citation recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.12366).
